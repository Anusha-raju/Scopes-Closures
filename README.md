# Session 7

## TOPIC: Scopes & Closures





#### ***ASSIGNMENT***

1. Write a closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable (+ 4 tests) 
2. Write a closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number (+ 2 tests) 
3. We wrote a closure that counts how many times a function was called. Write a new one that can keep a track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a global dictionary variable with the counts (+ 6 tests) 
4. Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries (+ 6 tests) 





#### ***Solution:***



1]  docstring is a closure which counts the length of docstring in the input function

```python
def docstring():
    """ This a closure which counts the length of the docstring"""
    count = 0 # this is free variable which keeps the count of characters in docstring of the function
    def counter(fn):
        ''' This function counts the characters in 'fn':function and prints relavent message.
        INPUT: fn : Function
        OUTPUT: RELEVANT message regarding the length of docstring
        '''
        if not isfunction(fn):
            raise TypeError("Inappropriate INPUT:please send in a function")
        nonlocal count
        count = len(fn.__doc__)
        if count > 50:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    return counter
```

 FIBONACCI numbers: The **Fibonacci sequence** is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0, and 1. The **Fibonacci Sequence**: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55â€¦

fibonacci returns a function which when called returns the next fibonacci number 

```pyhton
def fibonacci():
    """ This is a closure which calculates the next fibonacci number"""
    f,s = 0,1 # initial values of a fibonacci series
    def next(): # this function prints the next fibonacci number
        nonlocal f,s
        number = f
        f,s = s,f+s # calculates the next fibonacci number
        return number
    return next
```

func_counter is a closure which counts the number of times a function is called and stores the count in a global dictionary.

```
count_dict = dict() #global dictionary
def func_counter(fn):
    ''' This is a closure which counts the number of times a function: fn
        is called and stores the count in a global dictionary
        INPUT: fn : Function
        OUTPUT: returns the function: fn
    '''
    count = 0
    def function_counter(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count
        if not isfunction(fn):
            raise TypeError("please send in a function")
        count += 1
        count_dict[fn.__name__] = count
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    return function_counter
```

|      test_global_dictionary       |    This function tests the global dicitonary{count_dict}     |





4] func_counter_dict is a closure which counts the number of times a function is called and stores the count in a dictionary.

```python
def func_counter_dict(fn:'Function' , dictionary:'dict'):
    ''' This is a closure which counts the number of times a function: fn
        is called and stores the count in a dictionary.
        INPUT:  fn: Function
                dictionary: dict
        OUTPUT: returns the function: fn
    '''
    count_var = 0
    def counter_1_dict(*args, **kwargs):
        nonlocal count_var
        if isinstance(dictionary, dict) and isfunction(fn):
            count_var += 1
            dictionary[fn.__name__] = count_var
        else:
            raise TypeError("Please enter a dictionary type variable and send in a function")
        return fn(*args, **kwargs)
    return counter_1_dict
```
